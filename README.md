# Music Instrument Recognition
The goal for this project is to develop a machine
learning model for string instruments classification. We use
various signal processing techniques to calculate useful features
from instruments sound recordings. These calculated features are
then used for training a support vector machine classifier. We
achieved 75% accuracy on a subset of IRMAS dataset.
